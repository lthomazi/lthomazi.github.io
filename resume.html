        <h2>Experience</h2>
       
        <p><b>University Of Maryland - <i>Teaching Fellow</b></i> &nbsp;&nbsp; Jan 2022 - Dec 2022</p>
        <p>As a teaching fellow for an electronics class at the University of Maryland, I was responsible for grading and providing feedback on lab reports covering topics such as digital logic, microcontrollers, and signal conditioning. I also conducted office hours to assist students with course content and developed instructional materials. Additionally, I attended faculty meetings to voice concerns and provide suggestions. The class itself covered a wide range of topics essential to the design of engineering products that combine mechanics, electronics, and computational/command-and-control software. This included digital logic, microcontrollers and their peripherals, programming, sensing, signal conditioning (Fourier transforms, noise, filters), and actuation. My experience as a teaching fellow allowed me to gain valuable skills in education and mentorship, while also deepening my understanding of electronics and their practical applications.</p>

        <p><b>Robotics At Maryland - <i>Mechanical and Software Engineer</b></i> &nbsp;&nbsp; Oct 2021 - Dec 2021</p>
        <p>During my time at Robotics at Maryland, I had the opportunity to work on a new project developing software to control a four-legged robot named Testudog. My main responsibility was to write software to allow the team to test the chosen motors. As one of the few mechanical engineers, I had a better understanding of the motor properties and was able to write software that could easily tweak these motor parameters for testing. This required learning new programming languages such as C and Python, as well as collaborating with students of varying levels of experience. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in software development and project management, and it was exciting to be a part of a team working on such an innovative project.</p>

        <p><b>Elite Spice - <i>Process Control Engineering Intern</b></i> &nbsp;&nbsp; Jun 2021 - Aug 2021</p>
        <p>During my summer internship at Elite Spice, I had the opportunity to work as a Process Control Science Intern. My responsibilities involved assisting the Food Safety/Process Controls Department in various ongoing research projects, conducting food safety studies, and day-to-day activities related to Elite Spice's preventive control procedures and cultural development. I collaborated with the team to improve manufacturing efficiency by 20% through experimentation and analysis, designed experiments for food safety and process control research projects, and gathered and refined data to ensure compliance with regulatory agencies. Through this internship, I gained valuable experience in scientific research and analysis, food manufacturing, and compliance testing and reporting. I also developed my communication and teamwork skills by working alongside technical and non-technical staff in a team environment.</p>
