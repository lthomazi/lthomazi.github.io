I am a senior mechanical engineer and sophomore computer science student from the University Of Maryland. I've always been mesmerized by machines, and last year developed a taste for all things technology. I figured that the next logical step would be to get into robotics which I found to be a great passion. Because of that, I find myself constantly working on multiple side projects and learning more about the ever-growing field of computers and mechanical machines. So, I've created this website to share a bit about what I've worked on with you.
