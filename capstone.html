                <h1>Autonomous Solar Panel Cleaning Robot: A Capstone Project</h1>
                <p>As our world evolves and seeks more sustainable energy sources, the importance and reliance on solar panels are increasing. However, their efficiency decreases over time due to dust and other environmental factors, necessitating regular cleaning. My team - comprising Manav Chaudhary, Nicole DiGiambattista, Catherine Dommers, Landon Phan, and Eric Whitescarver - and I recognized this problem and decided to address it for our capstone project during our mechanical engineering degree at the University of Maryland. We're proud to announce that our project won 3rd place for Peoples Choice out of more than 30 competing groups.</p>

        <h3>Our Solution</h3>

        <p>Our solution is an autonomous cleaning robot designed for commercial solar farms. The robot employs a 'plug and play' philosophy, integrating seamlessly into existing solar panel installations without the need for additional infrastructure.</p>

        <p>The robot is designed to navigate the solar panels autonomously, using wheels and treads to traverse the panel arrays. It features two motors - one powering locomotion and the other driving a cleaning brush placed on the front side of the robot. The brush is programmed to spin in the opposite direction of the robot's movement, thereby increasing cleaning efficiency.</p>

        <h3>Navigational Aid</h3>

        <p>A major challenge was navigating the robot between solar panels. Our solution was to integrate two ultrasonic sensors to distinguish between gaps and the ends of panels. These sensors enable the robot to traverse the full length of the panel array, accurately counting the gaps regardless of the array's length.</p>

        <h3>Cleaning System</h3>

        <p>The cleaning system involves a solenoid valve attached to a water hose that dispenses water in front of the brush. This water, combined with the brush's mechanical action, ensures a thorough cleaning of the panels.</p>

        <p>The microcontroller, acting as the robot's brain, coordinates all functions: processing data from the ultrasonic sensors, controlling the movement of the brush and the treads, and regulating water flow.</p>

        <h3>Design Evolution</h3>

        <p>We made significant changes to our design since our initial report. The most significant was the addition of more wheels to prevent the robot from getting stuck between panels. We also shifted from three-phase brushless motors to two-phase brushless motors. This change improved control and cost-effectiveness, making these motors a better fit for our design.</p>

        <p>The brush attachment piece, which connects both the brush and water systems to the frame, was another crucial component. Bearings are press fit into the brush attachment piece for the brush axle. The brush shaft is mounted and set in place with a set screw.</p>

        <h3>Future Improvements</h3>

        <p>Our future plans include optimizing costs, enhancing ergonomic features, and waterproofing the electrical components. The ergonomic improvements will facilitate a more feasible mounting process, including adding a grip for better traction and side handles. The app used for the robot's actuation will also be enhanced for a quicker response time and more features.</p>

        <h3>Impact and Learning Experience</h3>

        <p>This capstone project has not only provided us with invaluable technical experience but also honed our project management and teamwork skills. Despite numerous challenges, our team persisted, resulting in a successful and functional prototype. Our robot has potential for mass production, with a break-even point within two years, depending on the size of the solar panel array, potentially saving up to $100,000.</p>

        <p>As we continue to improve upon our design, we're excited to keep contributing to the world of sustainable energy. This project was a significant step in our engineering journey, and we look forward to bringing more innovative solutions to real-world challenges.</p>

        <p>Stay tuned for more updates on our journey and the continued evolution of our autonomous solar panel cleaning robot!</p>
