        <h1>My interests and experience:</h1>
       
        <p>Coding is my passion and hobby. I love creating programs that interact with hardware. When I was part of the robotics club at UMD, our team was starting a new project, and there were no set roles yet. I took the opportunity to create software that would talk to the motor, making it easy to change its parameters. This allowed the software engineers to control the motor without having to know all the details of how it works. That project was a turning point for me and made me realize that I wanted a career that blended engineering and computer science. I have a strong foundation in engineering which helps me understand how hardware works and the computer science skills to create reliable programs that communicate with that hardware. I'm always looking for ways to grow in both fields and I think this makes me a great fit for this position.</p>

        <p>I am proficient in C, Rust, Python, and Java. Although I haven't had a chance to work with C++ yet, I am currently enrolled in a C++ course on LinkedIn to expand my knowledge.        </p>

The goal of the project was to use an ESP32 to control the brightness of three individual LEDs using PWM and Python to deploy an HTML page accessed over WiFi. There are speaker notes in the 'speaker notes' section.</p>
